NegBio is a high-performance NLP tool for negation and uncertainty detection in clinical texts (e.g. radiology reports).


## Update

We are updating the NegBio's pipeline. To use the order version, please see [v0.9.4](https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/NegBio/tree/v0.9.4).


## Get started

1. Download NegBio

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/NegBio.git
    cd /path/to/negbio
    ```

2. Prepare the dataset. 
   The inputs can be in either plain text or [BioC](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/) format. If the reports are in plain text, each report needs to be in a single file. Some examples can be found in the `examples` folder.

3. Run the script. See [User guide](https://negbio2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html).
